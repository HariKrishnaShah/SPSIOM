		<h2>Performance Evaluation Report </h2>

		<p>When analysing sport, we understand there are key physical and neurological attributes that can enhance an athlete’s performance. Broadly speaking, athletes need a high level of strength and mental ability to perform well. The only way we can be sure of ones improvement in these areas is to assess them with valid and reliable testing. We take the guess work out, so the athletes get the best service possible using real data specific to them.<br><br>

Throughout years of experience, working with athletes from a wide range of sports, we believe the key areas of performance are as follow:-<br><br>

<strong>Flexibility</strong> – Indication of tightness that can lead to loss of performance or injury.<br><br>

<strong>Strength</strong> – core and muscular strength. Imbalances can lead to loss of performance and injury.<br><br>

<strong>Movement</strong> – Assessing, basic, functional movement patterns. We use movement analysis software to look for asymmetries that could impede performance or lead to risk of injury in the future.

Power & Speed – Increasing your power and speed will enhance your performance in competition.<br><br>

<strong>Cognitive function</strong> – Cognitive function comprises of peripheral vision, concentration, awareness, decision making under pressure and the ability to track multiple objects simultaneously. Mental performance is extremely underrated in sport. Elite athletes now include cognitive training in their training schedules.<br><br>

<strong>Cardiovascular Fitness</strong> – are you fit enough for the demands of your sport?<br><br>

<strong>Body Composition</strong> – Monitoring body composition is a great way to track physiological changes if you are making changes to your training and/or diet plan. Body composition can have a direct impact on sport performance.<br><br>

We are the only company in the Isle of Man, to offer such a comprehensive athlete evaluation. All assessments will be done within the same appointment. Please allow for 2 hours. Once all the data has been compiled, we will write the report and sent a hard copy to you via post.<br><br>

If you would are interested in partaking in a full assessment and understanding your strengths and areas of improvement to become a better athlete, please get in touch. <a href = "mailto:performance@spsiom.com">Performance@spsiom.com</a></p>
