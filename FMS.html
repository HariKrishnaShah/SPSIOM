		<h2>Functional Movement Screening </h2>

		<p>Before embarking on a programme, regardless of your training goal, the first thought should be on injury prevention.<br><br>

We look at basic, fundamental movement patterns and assess whether there are any muscular weaknesses or imbalances, as well as any alignment issues that may be problematic further down the line if not corrected.<br><br>

As a client of Sports Performance Services Ltd, we will perform a functional movement screening on you. This will allow us to factor in any necessary exercises into your programme allowing you to train, and compete, better as well as reducing the risk of injury.<br><br>

If you are working through your own programmes – which many of you will be, we still strongly advise you to have a FMS performed so you can build in corrective exercises into your own programmes.<br><br>

Testing takes up to 45mins and will include flexibility, mobility, stability, strength and balance. Please contact us to learn more or book an appointment- <a href = "mailto:performance@spsiom.com">Performance@spsiom.com .</a></p>
