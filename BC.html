		<h2>Body Composition</h2>

		<p>Body Composition is a great way to monitor any physiological changes that occur when working through your programme or new diet changes.<br><br>

We recommend body composition testing for anyone who has an interest in their own health and fitness, from weekly gym-goers through to athletes.<br><br>

At Sports Performance Services Ltd, we use professional skinfold calipers that not only allow us to gain an accurate overall body fat % but perhaps more importantly the distribution of your body fat looking across 7 different body sites. We obtain millimetre readings per site which are converted to percentages.<br><br>

There are misconceptions when it comes to body fat; we are firm believers that you shouldn’t be hooked on what the weighing scales tell you. Skinfold caliper measurements are proven to be far more accurate that scales. We prefer to have more in depth knowledge with what’s going in with your body using real data.<br><br>After all, you can still weigh the same weight, but have reductions in body fat % and increase your lean mass.

Coupled with caliper measurements, we will also monitor your height and various circumference measurements across the body; this helps us understand correlations and how your body is changing.<br><br>

Appointments take 30mins. If you have any questions or would like to book an appointment, please e-mail <a href = "mailto:performance@spsiom.com">performance@spsiom.com.</a></p>
